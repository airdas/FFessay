abstract = {This paper presents an overview of recent highlights from research on Alcator C-Mod. Significant progress has been made across all research areas over the last two years, with particular emphasis on divertor physics and power handling, plasma–material interaction studies, edge localized mode-suppressed pedestal dynamics, core transport and turbulence, and RF heating and current drive utilizing ion cyclotron and lower hybrid tools. Specific results of particular relevance to ITER include: inner wall SOL transport studies that have led, together with results from other experiments, to the change of the detailed shape of the inner wall in ITER; runaway electron studies showing that the critical electric field required for runaway generation is much higher than predicted from collisional theory; core tungsten impurity transport studies reveal that tungsten accumulation is naturally avoided in typical C-Mod conditions.},

@article{Wade2015,
abstract = {Recent experiments on DIII-D have increased confidence in the ability to suppress edge-localized modes (ELMs) using edge-resonant magnetic perturbations (RMPs) in ITER, including an improved physics basis for the edge response to RMPs as well as expansion of RMP ELM suppression to more ITER-like conditions. Complete ELM suppression has been achieved utilizing n = 3 RMPs in the ITER baseline scenario. In addition, RMP ELM suppression has been expanded to include plasmas with helium concentrations near 25{\%} and the use of n = 2 RMPs. Analysis of the kinetic profile response suggests that ELM suppression is correlated with the co-alignment of the $\omega$ ⊥e = 0 location, an n = 3 rational surface, and the top of the pedestal. Modelling predicts that such a co-alignment could potentially lead to island (or island chain) formation just inside the top of the pedestal, inhibiting the growth of the pedestal and thereby maintaining the ELM-free state. Detailed analysis of data obtained during toroidal phase variations of the applied n = 3 RMPs have provided further evidence of an island-like structure at the top of the pedestal. In addition, nearly matched discharges with co-neutral-beam-injection (co-NBI) and counter-NBI have demonstrated the importance of the presence of the $\omega$ ⊥e = 0 location for ELM suppression. In the counter-NBI cases, the toroidal rotation profile is such that there is no $\omega$ ⊥e = 0 location and ELMs are not suppressed in conditions in which ELM suppression is generally observed with co-NBI.},

@article{Chapman2014,
abstract = {An increase in ELM frequency has been demonstrated in MAST by applying resonant magnetic perturbations (RMPs) with toroidal mode number, n RMP = 2, 3, 4, 6. It has been observed that the mitigated ELM frequency increases with the amplitude of the applied field provided it is above a critical threshold. This threshold value depends on the mode number of the RMP, with higher n RMP having a larger critical value. For the same ELM frequency, the reduction in the peak heat load on the divertor plates is approximately the same for all RMP configurations. The RMPs give rise to perturbations to the plasma shape, with lobe structures occurring due to the tangled magnetic fields near the X-point, and corrugations of the plasma boundary at the midplane. The X-point lobe length increases linearly with the applied field when above a threshold, with RMPs of higher toroidal mode number giving rise to longer lobes for the same applied resonant field. Similarly, the midplane displacements increase with the applied field strength, though the corrugation amplitude is less dependent upon the RMP configuration. For all n RMP , the RMPs result in enhanced particle transport and a reduction in the pedestal pressure gradient caused by an increased pedestal width, which is found to be consistent with a decrease in the critical pressure at which infinite- n ballooning modes are driven unstable in non-axisymmetric plasmas. The plasma rotation braking is strongest for lowest n RMP whilst the degradation of access to H-mode resultant from the application of RMPs are non-monotonic in n RMP , with the optimal case for both occurring for n RMP = 4. Whilst there are advantages and disadvantages for all RMP configurations, the configurations found to be optimised in terms of pedestal degradation, access to H-mode, plasma rotation and distortion to the plasma configuration in MAST are n RMP = 3 or 4, consistent with the configurations anticipated for use in ITER.},

@article{Loarte2014,
abstract = {The evolution of the parameters of the plasma in the termination phase of high confinement H-modes at JET with carbon fibre composite plasma facing components (JET-C) has been analysed with a view to predict the dynamics of the plasma energy decrease for sudden terminations of the ITER Q DT = 10 scenario caused by malfunction of additional heating systems. JET-C experiments show that the rate of decay of the plasma energy in the high performance H-mode termination phase is predominantly determined by the duration of the type III ELMy H-mode phase after the end of the type I ELMy H-mode regime. Longer type III ELMy H-mode phase durations lead to slower plasma energy decay rates. The duration of the type III ELMy H-mode phase is itself determined by the margin of the edge power flow (dominated by the rate of collapse of the plasma energy) over the H-mode threshold power in the termination phase, with larger margins leading to longer type III ELMy H-mode phase durations. For most of the JET-C discharges analysed the timescale for the plasma energy decrease in the termination of high energy confinement H-modes is comparable to the energy confinement time of the plasma in the high confinement phase rather than half of this value, which is to be expected for instantaneous H–L transitions. Modelling of the termination phase of ITER Q DT = 10 H-modes (with transport assumptions in this phase validated against JET-C experiments) shows that similar to JET-C results the timescale for the decrease of the plasma energy is comparable and can even be longer than the energy confinement time of the burning phase, provided that ELM control can be maintained. This is due to the long sustainment of the type III ELMy H-mode by the substantial edge power flow compared to the H-mode threshold power during this phase. The large edge power flow in the termination phase of ITER high Q DT plasmas is provided by the decrease of the plasma energy and the slow collapse of the alpha heating. Operational strategies in ITER to control the energy decay rate as well as the consequences of the lack of ELM control in the high Q DT termination phase are presented.},

@article{Loarte2014a,
abstract = {Progress in the definition of the requirements for edge localized mode (ELM) control and the application of ELM control methods both for high fusion performance DT operation and non-active low-current operation in ITER is described. Evaluation of the power fluxes for low plasma current H-modes in ITER shows that uncontrolled ELMs will not lead to damage to the tungsten (W) divertor target, unlike for high-current H-modes in which divertor damage by uncontrolled ELMs is expected. Despite the lack of divertor damage at lower currents, ELM control is found to be required in ITER under these conditions to prevent an excessive contamination of the plasma by W, which could eventually lead to an increased disruptivity. Modelling with the non-linear MHD code JOREK of the physics processes determining the flow of energy from the confined plasma onto the plasma-facing components during ELMs at the ITER scale shows that the relative contribution of conductive and convective losses is intrinsically linked to the magnitude of the ELM energy loss. Modelling of the triggering of ELMs by pellet injection for DIII-D and ITER has identified the minimum pellet size required to trigger ELMs and, from this, the required fuel throughput for the application of this technique to ITER is evaluated and shown to be compatible with the installed fuelling and tritium re-processing capabilities in ITER. The evaluation of the capabilities of the ELM control coil system in ITER for ELM suppression is carried out (in the vacuum approximation) and found to have a factor of ∼2 margin in terms of coil current to achieve its design criterion, although such a margin could be substantially reduced when plasma shielding effects are taken into account. The consequences for the spatial distribution of the power fluxes at the divertor of ELM control by three-dimensional (3D) fields are evaluated and found to lead to substantial toroidal asymmetries in zones of the divertor target away from the separatrix. Therefore, specifications for the rotation of the 3D perturbation applied for ELM control in order to avoid excessive localized erosion of the ITER divertor target are derived. It is shown that a rotation frequency in excess of 1 Hz for the whole toroidally asymmetric divertor power flux pattern is required (corresponding to n Hz frequency in the variation of currents in the coils, where n is the toroidal symmetry of the perturbation applied) in order to avoid unacceptable thermal cycling of the divertor target for the highest power fluxes and worst toroidal power flux asymmetries expected. The possible use of the in-vessel vertical stability coils for ELM control as a back-up to the main ELM control systems in ITER is described and the feasibility of its application to control ELMs in low plasma current H-modes, foreseen for initial ITER operation, is evaluated and found to be viable for plasma currents up to 5–10 MA depending on modelling assumptions.},

abstract = {Sustained edge-localized mode (ELM) mitigation has been achieved using resonant magnetic perturbations (RMPs) with a toroidal mode number of n = 4 and n = 6 in lower single null and with n = 3 in connected double null plasmas on MAST. The ELM frequency increases by up to a factor of eight with a similar reduction in ELM energy loss. A threshold current for ELM mitigation is observed above which the ELM frequency increases approximately linearly with current in the coils. A comparison of the filament structures observed during the ELMs in the natural and mitigated stages shows that the mitigated ELMs have the characteristics of type I ELMs even though their frequency is higher, their energy loss is reduced and the pedestal pressure gradient is decreased. During the ELM mitigated stage clear lobe structures are observed in visible-light imaging of the X-point region. The size of these lobes is correlated with the increase in ELM frequency observed. The RMPs produce a clear 3D distortion to the plasma and it is likely that these distortions explain why ELMs are destabilized and hence why ELM mitigation occurs.},

abstract = {Type-I edge-localized modes (ELMs) have been suppressed in DIII-D (Luxon et al 2003 Nucl. Fusion 43 1813) H-mode discharges with a H-98Y2 confinement factor near 1.0 using magnetic perturbations (MPs) with dominant toroidal mode number n = 2. This expands access to the ELM-suppressed regime, which was previously attainable in DIII-D only with n = 3 fields. ELM suppression is obtained with two rows of internal coils for 1.8 s with normalized beta of 1.9 and average triangularity of 0.53, corresponding to a scaled version of ITER scenario 2 at an ITER relevant electron collisionality of 0.2. The applied field reduces the pedestal pressure and edge current via the density without degrading the edge thermal transport barrier. ELITE calculations find that the resulting profiles are stable to intermediate-n peeling-ballooning modes. ELM suppression is found within different ranges of q(95) depending on the coil configuration used to generate the MP. The edge safety factors associated with suppression do not correspond to those that maximize the pitch-resonant components of the applied vacuum field. Instead, ELM suppression is correlated with an increase in the amplification of kink-resonant components of the calculated ideal MHD plasma response field.},

abstract = {A multi-machine database for the H-mode scrape-off layer power fall-off length, $\lambda$q in JET, DIII-D, ASDEX Upgrade, C-Mod, NSTX and MAST has been assembled under the auspices of the International Tokamak Physics Activity. Regression inside the database finds that the most important scaling parameter is the poloidal magnetic field (or equivalently the plasma current), with $\lambda$q decreasing linearly with increasing Bpol. For the conventional aspect ratio tokamaks, the regression finds , yielding $\lambda$q,ITER ≅ 1 mm for the baseline inductive H-mode burning plasma scenario at Ip = 15 MA. The experimental divertor target heat flux profile data, from which $\lambda$q is derived, also yield a divertor power spreading factor (S) which, together with $\lambda$q, allows an integral power decay length on the target to be estimated. There are no differences in the $\lambda$q scaling obtained from all-metal or carbon dominated machines and the inclusion of spherical tokamaks has no significant influence on the regression parameters. Comparison of the measured $\lambda$q with the values expected from a recently published heuristic drift based model shows satisfactory agreement for all tokamaks.},

abstract = {All current estimations of the energy released by type I ELMs indicate that, in order to ensure an adequate lifetime of the divertor targets on ITER, a mechanism is required to decrease the amount of energy released by an ELM, or to eliminate ELMs altogether. One such amelioration mechanism relies on perturbing the magnetic field in the edge plasma region, either leading to more frequent, smaller ELMs (ELM mitigation) or ELM suppression. This technique of Resonant Magnetic Perturbations (RMPs) has been employed to suppress type I ELMs at high collisionality/density on DIII-D, ASDEX Upgrade, KSTAR and JET and at low collisionality on DIII-D. At ITER-like collisionality the RMPs enhance the transport of particles or energy and keep the edge pressure gradient below the 2D linear ideal MHD critical value that would trigger an ELM, whereas at high collisionality/density the type I ELMs are replaced by small type II ELMs. Although ELM suppression only occurs within limitied operational ranges, ELM mitigation is much more easily achieved. The exact parameters that determine the onset of ELM suppression are unknown but in all cases the magnetic perturbations produce 3D distortions to the plasma and enhanced particle transport. The incorporation of these 3D effects in codes will be essential in order to make quantitative predictions for future devices.},

abstract = {Since the first H-mode discharges in 2010, the duration of the H-mode state has been extended and a significantly wider operational window of plasma parameters has been attained. Using a second neutral beam (NB) source and improved tuning of equilibrium configuration with real-time plasma control, a stored energy of W tot ∼ 450 kJ has been achieved with a corresponding energy confinement time of $\tau$ E ∼ 163 ms. Recent discharges, produced in the fall of 2012, have reached plasma $\beta$ N up to 2.9 and surpassed the n = 1 ideal no-wall stability limit computed for H-mode pressure profiles, which is one of the key threshold parameters defining advanced tokamak operation. Typical H-mode discharges were operated with a plasma current of 600 kA at a toroidal magnetic field B T = 2 T. L–H transitions were obtained with 0.8–3.0 MW of NB injection power in both single- and double-null configurations, with H-mode durations up to ∼15 s at 600 kA of plasma current. The measured power threshold as a function of line-averaged density showed a roll-over with a minimum value of ∼0.8 MW at {\#}{\#}IMG{\#}{\#} [http://ej.iop.org/images/0029-5515/53/10/104005/nf455467ieqn001.gif] {\{}$\backslash$bar{\{}n{\}}{\_}{\{}$\backslash$rm e{\}}{\~{}}2$\backslash$times 10{\^{}}{\{}19{\}}$\backslash$,{\{}$\backslash$rm m{\}}{\^{}}{\{}-3{\}}{\}} . Several edge-localized mode (ELM) control techniques during H-mode were examined with successful results including resonant magnetic perturbation, supersonic molecular beam injection (SMBI), vertical jogging and electron cyclotron current drive injection into the pedestal region. We observed various ELM responses, i.e. suppression or mitigation, depending on the relative phase of in-vessel control coil currents. In particular, with the 90° phase of the n = 1 RMP as the most resonant configuration, a complete suppression of type-I ELMs was demonstrated. In addition, fast vertical jogging of the plasma column was also observed to be effective in ELM pace-making. SMBI-mitigated ELMs, a state of mitigated ELMs, were sustained for a few tens of ELM periods. A simple cellular automata (‘sand-pile') model predicted that shallow deposition near the pedestal foot induced small-sized high-frequency ELMs, leading to the mitigation of large ELMs. In addition to the ELM control experiments, various physics topics were explored focusing on ITER-relevant physics issues such as the alteration of toroidal rotation caused by both electron cyclotron resonance heating (ECRH) and externally applied 3D fields, and the observed rotation drop by ECRH in NB-heated plasmas was investigated in terms of either a reversal of the turbulence-driven residual stress due to the transition of ion temperature gradient to trapped electron mode turbulence or neoclassical toroidal viscosity (NTV) torque by the internal kink mode. The suppression of runaway electrons using massive gas injection of deuterium showed that runaway electrons were avoided only below 3 T in KSTAR. Operation in 2013 is expected to routinely exceed the n = 1 ideal MHD no-wall stability boundary in the long-pulse H-mode (⩾10 s) by applying real-time shaping control, enabling n = 1 resistive wall mode active control studies. In addition, intensive works for ELM mitigation, ELM dynamics, toroidal rotation changes by both ECRH and NTV variations, have begun in the present campaign, and will be investigated in more detail with profile measurements of different physical quantities by techniques such as electron cyclotron emission imaging, charge exchange spectroscopy, Thomson scattering and beam emission spectroscopy diagnostics.},

abstract = {Operating ITER in the reference inductive scenario at the design values of Ip = 15MA andQDT = 10 requires the achievement of good H-mode confinement that relies on the presence of an edge transport barrier whose pedestal pressure height is key to plasma performance. Strong gradients occur at the edge in such conditions that can drive magnetohydrodynamic instabilities resulting in edge localized modes (ELMs), which produce a rapid energy loss from the pedestal region to the plasma facing components (PFC). Without appropriate control, the heat loads on PFCs during ELMs in ITER are expected to become significant for operation in H-mode at Ip = 6–9MA; operation at higher plasma currents would result in a very reduced life time of the PFCs. Currently, several options are being considered for the achievement of the required level of ELM control in ITER; this includes operation in plasma regimes which naturally have no or very small ELMs, decreasing the ELM energy loss by increasing their frequency by a factor of up to 30 and avoidance of ELMs by actively controlling the edge with magnetic perturbations. Small/no ELM regimes obtained by influencing the edge stability (by plasma shaping, rotational shear control, etc) have shown in present experiments a significant reduction of the ELM heat fluxes compared to type-I ELMs. However, so far they have only been observed under a limited range of pedestal conditions depending on each specific device and their extrapolation to ITER remains uncertain. ELM control by increasing their frequency relies on the controlled triggering of the edge instability leading to the ELM. This has been presently demonstrated with the injection of pellets and with plasma verticalmovements; pellets having provided the results more promising for application in ITER conditions. ELM avoidance/suppression takes advantage of the fact that relatively small changes in the pedestal plasma and magnetic field parameters seem to have a large stabilizing effect on large ELMs. Application of edge magnetic field perturbation with non-axisymmetric fields is found to affect transport at the plasma edge and thus prevent the uncontrolled rise of the plasma pressure gradients and the occurrence of type-I ELMs. This paper compiles a brief overview of various ELM control approaches, summarizes their present achievements and briefly discusses the open issues regarding their application in ITER.},

abstract = {Mitigation of type-I edge-localized modes (ELMs) was observed with the application of an n = 2 field in H-mode plasmas on the JET tokamak with the ITER-like wall (ILW). Several new findings with the ILW were identified and contrasted to the previous carbon wall (C-wall) results for comparable conditions. Previous results for high collisionality plasmas (nu*(e,ped) similar to 2.0) with the C-wall saw little or no influence of either n = 1 or n = 2 fields on the ELMs. However, recent observations with the ILW show large type-I ELMs with a frequency of similar to 45 Hz were replaced by high-frequency (similar to 200 Hz) small ELMs during the application of the n = 2 field. With the ILW, splitting of the outer strike point was observed for the first time during the strong mitigation of the type-I ELMs. The maximal surface temperature (T-max) on the outer divertor plate reached a stationary state and has only small variations of a few degrees due to the small mitigated ELMs. In moderate collisionality (nu*(e,ped) similar to 0.8) H-mode plasmas, similar to previous results with the C-wall, both an increase in the ELM frequency and density pump-out were observed during the application of the n = 2 field. There are two new observations compared with the C-wall results. Firstly, the effect of ELM mitigation with the n = 2 field was seen to saturate so that the ELM frequency did not further increase above a certain level of n = 2 magnetic perturbations. Secondly splitting of the outer strike point during the ELM crash was seen, resulting in mitigation of the maximal ELM peak heat fluxes on the divertor region.},

abstract = {Non-axisymmetric magnetic perturbations (MPs) were successfully applied at ASDEX Upgrade to substantially reduce the plasma energy loss and peak divertor power load that occur concomitant with type-I edge localized modes (ELMs). The response of electron density edge profiles and temperature and pressure pedestal-top values to MPs are reported. ELM mitigation is observed above an edge density threshold and independent of the MPs being resonant or non-resonant with the edge safety factor. The edge electron collisionality appears not to be appropriate to separate mitigated from non-mitigated discharges for the present high-collisionality plasmas. No significant change in the position or gradient of the edge density profile could be observed for the transition into the ELM-mitigated phase, except from the effect of the three-dimensional MP field which leads to an apparent profile shift. An increase in the density and decrease in the temperature at the pedestal-top balance such that the pressure saturates at the value of the pre-mitigated phase. The plasma stored energy, the normalized plasma pressure, and the H-mode quality factor follow closely the evolution of the pedestal-top pressure and thus remain almost unaffected. The temporal evolution of the ion effective charge shows that the impurity content does not increase although flushing through type-I ELMs is missing. The type-I ELMs are replaced in the mitigated phase by small-scale and high-frequency edge perturbations. The effect of the small bursts on the density profile, which is correlated with a transient increase of the divertor thermoelectric current, is small compared with the effect of the type-I ELMs. The residual scatter of the profiles in the mitigated phase is small directly after the transition into the ELM-mitigated phase and increases again when the pressure saturates at the value of the pre-mitigated phase.},

During the ELM mitigated stage clear lobe structures are observed in visible-light imaging of the X-point region. These lobes or manifold structures, that were predicted previously, have been observed for the first time in a range of discharges and their appearance is correlated with the effect of RMPs on the plasma; i.e., they only appear above a threshold when a density pump out is observed or when the ELM frequency is increased. They appear to be correlated with the RMPs penetrating the plasma and may be important in explaining why the ELM frequency increases. The number and location of the structures observed can be well described using vacuum modeling. Differences in radial extent and poloidal width from vacuum modeling are likely to be due to a combination of transport effects and plasma screening.},

Vacuum-field calculations show that these perturbations take the form of lobes extending outwards from the unperturbed separatrix. These structures can be resolved in experiment by performing a differential measurement of the image for different toroidal phases of the applied perturbation. Forward modelling of the line-integrated image with a synthetic diagnostic is used to directly compare the measurement with vacuum-field calculations. Results indicate the existence of these lobes match well with the measured data. These lobes are observed to shift poloidally on the high-field side of the magnetic axis as the edge magnetic safety factor is varied, consistent with vacuum-field calculations.},

abstract = {A comprehensive set of L–H transition experiments has been performed on DIII-D to determine the requirements for access to H-mode plasmas in ITER's first (non-nuclear) operational phase with H and He plasmas and the second (activated) operational phase with D plasmas. The H-mode power threshold, PTH, was evaluated for different operational configurations and auxiliary heating methods for the different main ion species. Helium plasmas have significantly higher PTH than deuterium plasmas at low densities for all heating schemes, but similar PTH as deuterium plasmas at high densities except for H-neutral beam injection-heated discharges, which are still higher. Changes in PTH are observed when helium concentration levels in deuterium plasmas exceed 40{\%}. There is a strong dependence of PTH on the magnetic geometry in the vicinity of the divertor. The trend of decreasing PTH with decreasing X-point height is observed for all of the main ion species irrespective of the heating method, which appears to indicate that there is a common physics process behind this effect for all of the ion species. Helium and deuterium plasmas exhibit a significant increase in PTH for strong resonant magnetic perturbations. The application of a local magnetic ripple of 3{\%} from test blanket module mock-up coils did not change PTH in deuterium plasmas.},

abstract = {A minimum set of equations based on the peeling–ballooning (P–B) model with nonideal physics effects (diamagnetic drift, E × B drift, resistivity and anomalous electron viscosity) is found to simulate pedestal collapse when using the BOUT++ simulation code, developed in part from the original fluid edge code BOUT. Linear simulations of P–B modes find good agreement in growth rate and mode structure with ELITE calculations. The influence of the E × B drift, diamagnetic drift, resistivity, anomalous electron viscosity, ion viscosity and parallel thermal diffusivity on P–B modes is being studied; we find that (1) the diamagnetic drift and E × B drift stabilize the P–B mode in a manner consistent with theoretical expectations; (2) resistivity destabilizes the P–B mode, leading to resistive P–B mode; (3) anomalous electron and parallel ion viscosities destabilize the P–B mode, leading to a viscous P–B mode; (4) perpendicular ion viscosity and parallel thermal diffusivity stabilize the P–B mode. With addition of the anomalous electron viscosity under the assumption that the anomalous kinematic electron viscosity is comparable to the anomalous electron perpendicular thermal diffusivity, or the Prandtl number is close to unity, it is found from nonlinear simulations using a realistic high Lundquist number that the pedestal collapse is limited to the edge region and the ELM size is about 5–10{\%} of the pedestal stored energy. This is consistent with many observations of large ELMs. The estimated island size is consistent with the size of fast pedestal pressure collapse. In the stable $\alpha$-zones of ideal P–B modes, nonlinear simulations of viscous ballooning modes or current-diffusive ballooning mode (CDBM) for ITER H-mode scenarios are presented.},

abstract = {An improved energy confinement regime, I-mode, is studied in Alcator C-Mod, a compact high-field divertor tokamak using ion cyclotron range of frequencies (ICRFs) auxiliary heating. I-mode features an edge energy transport barrier without an accompanying particle barrier, leading to several performance benefits. H-mode energy confinement is obtained without core impurity accumulation, resulting in reduced impurity radiation with a high-Z metal wall and ICRF heating. I-mode has a stationary temperature pedestal with edge localized modes typically absent, while plasma density is controlled using divertor cryopumping. I-mode is a confinement regime that appears distinct from both L-mode and H-mode, combining the most favourable elements of both. The I-mode regime is investigated predominately with ion ∇B drift away from the active X-point. The transition from L-mode to I-mode is primarily identified by the formation of a high temperature edge pedestal, while the edge density profile remains nearly identical to L-mode. Laser blowoff injection shows that I-mode core impurity confinement times are nearly identical with those in L-mode, despite the enhanced energy confinement. In addition, a weakly coherent edge MHD mode is apparent at high frequency ∼100–300 kHz which appears to increase particle transport in the edge. The I-mode regime has been obtained over a wide parameter space (BT = 3–6 T, Ip = 0.7–1.3MA, q95 = 2.5–5). In general, the I-mode exhibits the strongest edge temperature pedestal (Tped) and normalized energy confinement (H98 {\textgreater} 1) at low q95 ({\textless}3.5) and high heating power (Pheat {\textgreater} 4MW). I-mode significantly expands the operational space of edge localized mode (ELM)-free, stationary pedestals in C-Mod to Tped ∼ 1 keV and low collisionality $\nu$∗ ped ∼ 0.1, as compared with EDA H-mode with Tped {\textless} 0.6 keV, $\nu$∗ has a relatively weak degradation with heating power;Wth ∼ IpP0.7 (Some figures in this article are in colour only in the electronic version},

abstract = {The pressure at the top of the edge transport barrier (or 'pedestal height') strongly impacts fusion performance, while large edge localized modes (ELMs), driven by the free energy in the pedestal region, can constrain material lifetimes. Accurately predicting the pedestal height and ELM behavior in ITER is an essential element of prediction and optimization of fusion performance. Investigation of intermediate wavelength MHD modes (or 'peeling--ballooning' modes) has led to an improved understanding of important constraints on the pedestal height and the mechanism for ELMs. The combination of high-resolution pedestal diagnostics, including substantial recent improvements, and a suite of highly efficient stability codes, has made edge stability analysis routine on several major tokamaks, contributing both to understanding, and to experimental planning and performance optimization. Here we present extensive comparisons of observations to predicted edge stability boundaries on several tokamaks, both for the standard (Type I) ELM regime, and for small ELM and ELM-free regimes. We further discuss a new predictive model for the pedestal height and width (EPED1), developed by self-consistently combining a simple width model with peeling--ballooning stability calculations. This model is tested against experimental measurements, and used in initial predictions of the pedestal height for ITER.},

abstract = {The mitigation or suppresion of large edge localized modes (ELMs) is a critical issue for successful operation of ITER. In recent years, a concerted worldwide effort has emerged to develop efficient and reliable ELM mitigation and suppression techniques that can be scaled to the full range of ITER regimes and more generally to burning plasmas in a generic fusion reactor design. These techniques include the use of small-ELM or ELM-free regimes, the repetitive triggering of ELMs by external means, and the suppression of ELMS with non-axisymmetric fields. The extrapolation of all of these techniques to ITER is highly uncertain due to outstanding physics issues. However, two techniques have emerged as the preferred methods for use in ITER: ELM pacing using pellet injection and the use of edge resonant magnetic perturbations for ELM suppression. This paper discusses the issues related to ELM control in ITER, provides a general introduction to various ELM control techniques, and a more detailed discussion of the physics and engineering requirements of the two preferred techniques for ELM control in ITER. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {In this paper the manipulation of power deposition on divertor targets at DIII-D by the application of resonant magnetic perturbations (RMPs) for suppression of large type-I edge localized modes (ELMs) is analysed. We discuss the modification of the ELM characteristics by the RMP applied. It is shown that the width of the deposition pattern in ELMy H-mode depends linearly on the ELM deposited energy, whereas in the RMP phase of the discharge those patterns are controlled by the externally induced magnetic perturbation. It was also found that the manipulation of heat transport due to the application of small, edge RMP depends on the plasma pedestal electron collisionality nu(e)*. We compare in this analysis RMP and no RMP phases with and without complete ELM suppression. At high nu(e)* {\textgreater} 0.5, the heat flux during the ELM suppressed phase is of the same order as the inter-ELM and the no-RMP phase. However, below this collisionality value, a slight increase in the total power flux to the divertor is observed during the RMP phase. This is most likely caused by a more negative potential at the divertor surface due to hot electrons reaching the divertor surface from the pedestal area along perturbed, open field lines.},

abstract = {Large Type-I edge localized modes (ELMs) are completely eliminated with small n = 3 resonant magnetic perturbations (RMP) in low average triangularity, (delta) over bar = 0.26, plasmas and in ITER similar shaped (ISS) plasmas, delta = 0.53, with ITER relevant collisionalities v(e)* {\textless}= 0.2. Significant differences in the RMP requirements and in the properties of the ELM suppressed plasmas are found when comparing the two triangularities. In ISS plasmas, the current required to suppress ELMs is approximately 25{\%} higher than in low average triangularity plasmas. It is also found that the width of the resonant q(95) window required for ELM suppression is smaller in ISS plasmas than in low average triangularity plasmas. An analysis of the positions and widths of resonant magnetic islands across the pedestal region, in the absence of resonant field screening or a self-consistent plasma response, indicates that differences in the shape of the q profile may explain the need for higher RMP coil currents during ELM suppression in ISS plasmas. Changes in the pedestal profiles are compared for each plasma shape as well as with changes in the injected neutral beam power and the RMP amplitude. Implications of these results are discussed in terms of requirements for optimal ELM control coil designs and for establishing the physics basis needed in order to scale this approach to future burning plasma devices such as ITER.},

abstract = {Recent DIII-D [J. L. Luxon , Nucl. Fusion 43, 1813 (2003)] experiments show a correlation between the extent of overlap of magnetic islands induced in the edge plasma by perturbation coils and complete suppression of Type-I edge localized modes (ELMs) in plasmas with ITER-like electron pedestal collisionality nu(e)*similar to 0.1, flux surface shape and low edge safety factor (q(95)approximate to 3.6). With fixed amplitude n=3 resonant magnetic perturbation (RMP), ELM suppression is obtained only in a finite window in the edge safety factor (q(95)) consistent with maximizing the resonant component of the applied helical field. ELM suppression is obtained over an increasing range of q(95) by either increasing the n=3 RMP strength, or by adding n=1 perturbations to "fill in" gaps between islands across the edge plasma. The suppression of Type-I ELMs correlates with a minimum width of the edge region having magnetic islands with Chirikov parameter {\textgreater}1.0, based on vacuum calculations of RMP mode components excluding the plasma response or rotational shielding. The fraction of vacuum magnetic field lines that are lost from the plasma, with connection length to the divertor targets comparable to an electron-ion collisional mean free path, increases throughout the island overlap region in the ELM suppressed case compared with the ELMing case.

abstract = {The understanding and predictive capability of transport physics and plasma confinement is reviewed from the perspective of achieving reactor-scale burning plasmas in the ITER tokamak, for both core and edge plasma regions. Very considerable progress has been made in understanding, controlling and predicting tokamak transport across a wide variety of plasma conditions and regimes since the publication of the ITER Physics Basis (IPB) document (1999 Nucl. Fusion 39 2137–2664). Major areas of progress considered here follow. (1) Substantial improvement in the physics content, capability and reliability of transport simulation and modelling codes, leading to much increased theory/experiment interaction as these codes are increasingly used to interpret and predict experiment. (2) Remarkable progress has been made in developing and understanding regimes of improved core confinement. Internal transport barriers and other forms of reduced core transport are now routinely obtained in all the leading tokamak devices worldwide. (3) The importance of controlling the H-mode edge pedestal is now generally recognized. Substantial progress has been made in extending high confinement H-mode operation to the Greenwald density, the demonstration of Type I ELM mitigation and control techniques and systematic explanation of Type I ELM stability. Theory-based predictive capability has also shown progress by integrating the plasma and neutral transport with MHD stability. (4) Transport projections to ITER are now made using three complementary approaches: empirical or global scaling, theory-based transport modelling and dimensionless parameter scaling (previously, empirical scaling was the dominant approach). For the ITER base case or the reference scenario of conventional ELMy H-mode operation, all three techniques predict that ITER will have sufficient confinement to meet its design target of Q = 10 operation, within similar uncertainties.},

abstract = {Pellets injected into type-I ELMy H-mode discharges are known to trigger edge-localized modes (ELMs). In order to understand the underlying processes the triggering mechanism was investigated in this paper. The major questions of the investigations to be answered were: at which magnetic surface was the ELM initiated and what was the corresponding perturbation caused by the ablating pellet? During the investigations the natural ELM cycle was probed by injecting pellets from the high field side of the ASDEX Upgrade tokamak with significantly lower frequency than the natural ELM frequency. To determine the location of the seed perturbation of the ablating pellet triggering an ELM, the dynamics of the triggered ELMs was linked to the time history of the pellet position in the plasma. TheELMonsetwas determined by analysing magnetic pick-up coil signals and its delay relative to the time when the pellet crossed the separatrix was measured as a function of the pellet velocity. Supposing that to trigger an ELM a pellet has to reach a certain magnetic surface of the plasma independently of its mass and velocity, the most probable location of the seed perturbationwas found to be at the middle of the pedestal—at the high plasma pressure gradient region. The onset of theMHDsignature of the ELMs was detected about 50µs after the pellet reached the seed position. According to our observations ELMs can be triggered either by the cooling of the pedestal region causing sudden increase of the pedestal plasma pressure gradient driving the plasma to the unstable region of the ballooning mode or by the strong MHD perturbation triggering an instability developing into an ELM.},

abstract = {An integrated radiative high performance scenario has been established at ASDEX Upgrade based on simultaneous feedback control of the average divertor neutral particle and power flux in combination with a high, pellet induced frequency of edge localized modes (ELMs). This approach is fully compatible with the present tungstenwall coating covering about 65{\%} of the plasma facing components and is intended for application in the envisaged full-tungsten experiment. In these experiments, divertor recycling and effective divertor temperature (derived from thermoelectric currents) were tuned by acting on fuel gas puff and argon injection rates. The ELM frequency (fELM) was kept high by repetitive injection of small cryogenic deuterium pellets to avoid the radiative instabilities seen at low fELM and high radiated power, and to control the ELM energy. No confinement loss is observed in this radiative type-I ELMy scenario with relatively flat density profiles. In contrast, similar type-III ELM scenarios achieved in hydrogen show a confinement loss of 25{\%} as compared to the type-I phase. In parallel to pellets, alternativeELMtrigger techniques have been investigated as well. Fast vertical plasma oscillations are able to synchronize theELMfrequency to values higher and lower than the intrinsic fELM, but remain to be tested in the integrated scenario. Supersonic gas injection showed better fuelling efficiencies than usual gas puffing but instantaneous ELM release has not been achieved. A particular experimental challenge for AUG conditions is to obtain a high pace making frequency, to establish scalings of confinement and energy loss as a function of controlled ELM frequency.},

QH-mode plasmas have high pedestal and core ion temperatures together with good High-confinement mode (H-mode). ELMs are replaced by continuous MHD oscillations, the 'edge harmonic oscillation' (EHO) and the 'high frequency oscillation'. Stationarity of particle and impurity densities is linked to the occurrence of these MHD modes. The EHO location in the steep-gradient region and its appearance with increasing edge pressure points towards the edge pressure or pressure gradient as possible drivers for the EHO. Injection of small cryogenic pellets can raise the plasma density to about 40{\%} of the Greenwald density limit without triggering ELMs. Orbit following calculations of the slowing-down distribution show the presence of an enhanced fast particle density in the H-mode barrier region despite the large loss currents with counter-injection. The radial electrical field in the edge barrier region, about twice as large in QH-mode as in ELMy H-mode, is large enough to reverse the precession drift direction of injected beam ions, leading to a resonance of the EHO with the drift precession frequency.},

abstract = {Washboard (WB) modes (Smeulders P et al 1999 Plasma Phys. Control. Fusion 41 1303) are a very common edge instability regularly observed in the H-mode regime in JET. They are detected as (normally several) bands of continuously fluctuating magnetic activity rotating in the direction of the electron diamagnetic drift with typical frequencies in the range of 10–90 kHz. The time evolution of the WB mode frequency is found to follow qualitatively the evolution of the electron temperature measured near the pedestal top, probably due to the strong diamagnetic drift associated with the large pedestal gradients. Evidence for their involvement in the pedestal and ELM dynamics will be presented. Increasing WB mode amplitude is correlated with an increase in the time between consecutive type-I ELMs. In situations in which a sudden increase (decrease) of WB mode activity is observed, the build-up of the pedestal temperature (and, linked to this, also of the pedestal pressure) of the electrons is seen to become slower (faster). This is a strong indication that the WB mode activity has a regulating effect on the pedestal and that it is responsible for an enhanced transport of energy across the separatrix. The occurrence of a class of type-I ELM precursor modes commonly observed in JET in discharges with low to moderate collisionality ( , roughly) (Perez C P et al EFDA-JET Preprint EFD-P(02)11) is found to be associated with a weakening of the WB modes. The underlying mechanism for this interaction has not been yet identified. In contrast to low triangularity discharges, WB activity is found to increase with gas puffing at high triangularity. This can provide an explanation for the regime recently identified on JET that has been called the mixed type-I/type-II ELM regime (Saibene G et al 2002 Plasma Phys. Control. Fusion 44 1769). A modified version of the peeling–ballooning cycle for type-I ELMs on JET that takes into account the WB mode phenomenon and is consistent with the experimental observations is proposed.This article was due to be published in issue 9 of Plasma Phys.

Similar eruptions occur in astrophysical plasmas, for example, in solar flares and magnetospheric substorms.

abstract = {The peeling-ballooning model for edge localized modes (ELMs) and pedestal constraints, based on ideal MHD instabilities driven by pressure gradients and current in the edge barrier region, has been broadly applied toward understanding ELM and pedestal behaviour in a number of tokamak experiments. Due in part to multiple driving terms, multiple wavelengths and second stability access physics, the peeling-ballooning stability limits which are proposed to constrain the pedestal and trigger ELMs depend sensitively on many details of the tokamak equilibrium. Here we present a technique for characterizing these stability constraints as a function of important parameters, using carefully constructed model equilibria. We discuss comparisons of calculated stability constraints to observed pedestal behaviour, in which an encouraging level of agreement is found. We then present results of an extensive series of calculations which characterize, the peeling-ballooning stability constraints as a function-of pedestal width, magnetic field, plasma current, density, and triangularity.},

abstract = {This paper presents the results of a preliminary assessment conducted to estimate the thermal response and erosion lifetime of the ITER divertor targets clad either with carbon-fibre composite or tungsten during type I ELMs. The one-dimensional thermal/erosion model, used for the analyses, is briefly described. It includes all the key surface heat transfer processes such as evaporation, melting, and radiation, and their interaction with the bulk thermal response, and it is based on an implicit finite-difference scheme, which allows for temperature-dependent material properties. The cases analysed clarify the influence of several ELM parameters on the heat transfer and erosion processes at the target (i.e. characteristic plasma ELM energy loss from the pedestal, fraction of the energy reaching the divertor, broadening of the strike-points during ELMs, duration and waveform of the ELM heat load) and design/material parameters (i.e. inclination of the target, type and thickness of the armour material, and for tungsten only, fraction of the melt layer loss). Comparison is made between cases where all ELMs are characterized by the same fixed averaged parameters, and cases where instead the characteristic parameters of each ELM are evaluated in a random fashion by using a standard Monte Carlo technique, based on distributions of some of the variables of interest derived from experiments in today's machines. Although uncertainties rule out providing firm quantitative predictions, the results of this study are useful to illustrate trends. Based on the results, the implications on the design and operation are discussed and priorities are determined for the R{\&}D needed to reduce the remaining uncertainties.},

abstract = {Analysis of Type I ELMs from ongoing experiments shows that ELM energy losses are correlated with the density and temperature of the pedestal plasma before the ELM crash. The Type I ELM plasma energy loss normalized to the pedestal energy is found to correlate across experiments with the collisionality of the pedestal plasma (v(ped)(*)),decreasing with increasing v(ped)(*). Other parameters affect the ELM size, such as the edge magnetic shear, etc, which influence the plasma volume affected by the ELMs. ELM particle losses are influenced by this ELM affected volume and are weakly dependent on other pedestal plasma parameters. In JET and DIII-D, under some conditions, ELMs can be observed ('minimum' Type I ELMs with energy losses acceptable for ITER), that do not affect the plasma temperature. The duration of the divertor ELM power pulse is correlated with the typical ion transport time from the pedestal to the divertor target (tau(parallel to)(Front) = 2piRq(95)/c(s,ped)) and not with the duration of the ELM-associated MHD activity. Similarly, the timescale of ELM particle fluxes is also determined by tau(parallel to)(Front). The extrapolation of the present experimental results to ITER is summarized.},

abstract = {Experiments on the TCV tokamak have shown that rapid vertical movement of diverted ELMy H-mode plasmas can affect the time sequence of edge localized modes. The effect is attributed to the induction of an edge current during the movement of the plasma column in the spatially inhomogeneous vacuum field of a single-null configuration. In TCV the fast vertical movement is provoked by the positional control coils inside the vacuum vessel, however it is argued that a similar effect might be produced in larger devices only using poloidal field coils external to the vessel. A simple model, which includes plausible elements of the dynamical behaviour of the edge pressure gradient and edge current, which together dictate the MHD stability of the discharge against edge-localized, current-driven modes, is used to reproduce some of the features seen in these experiments.},

abstract = {Injection of cryogenic deuterium pellets has been successfully applied in ASDEX Upgrade for external edge localized mode (ELM) frequency control in type-I ELMy H-mode discharge scenarios. A pellet velocity of 560 m s −1 and a size of about 6 × 10 19 D-atoms was selected for technical reasons, although even lower masses were found sufficient to trigger ELMs. A moderate repetition rate close to 20 Hz was chosen to avoid over-fuelling of the core plasma. Pellet sequences of up to 4 s duration were injected into discharges close to the L–H threshold, intrinsically developing large compound ELMs at a rate of 3 Hz. With pellet injection, these large ELMs were completely replaced by smaller type-I ELMs at the much higher pellet frequency, accompanied by a slight increase of density and even of stored energy. This external ELM control could be repeatedly switched on and off by just interrupting the pellet train. ELMs were triggered in less than 200 µs after pellet arrival at the plasma edge, at which time only a fraction of the pellet has been ablated, forming a rather localized, three-dimensional plasmoid, which drives the edge unstable well before the deposited mass is spread toroidally. The pellet controlled case has also been compared with a discharge at a somewhat lower density, but with otherwise rather similar data, developing spontaneous 20 Hz type-I ELMs. Despite the different trigger mechanisms, the general ELM features turn out to be qualitatively similar, possibly because of the similarity of the two cases in terms of ELM relevant parameters. The scaling with background plasma, heating power, pellet launch parameters, etc over a larger range still remains to be investigated.},

abstract = {Recent experiments on the Type I ELMy H-mode regime performed at JET with improved diagnostics have expanded the range of parameters for the study of Type I ELM energy and particle losses. Deviations from the standard behaviour of such losses in some areas of the Type I ELMy H-mode operating space have revealed that the ELM losses are correlated with the parameters (density and temperature) of the pedestal plasma before the ELM crash, while other global ELM characteristics (such as ELM frequency) are a consequence of the ELM-driven energy and particle flux and of the in-between ELM energy and particle confinement. The relative Type I ELM plasma energy loss (to the pedestal energy) is found to correlate well with the collisionality of the pedestal plasma, showing a weak dependence on the method used to achieve those pedestal plasma parameters: plasma shaping, heating, pellet injection and impurity seeding. Effects of edge plasma collisionality and transport along the magnetic field,on the Type I ELM particle and energy fluxes onto the divertor target have also been observed. Two possible physical mechanisms that may give rise to the observed collisionality dependence of ELM energy losses are proposed and their consistency with the experimental measurements investigated: collisionality dependence of the edge bootstrap current with its associated influence on the ELM MHD origin and the limitation of the ELM energy loss by the impedance of the divertor target sheath to energy flow during the ELM event.},

abstract = {Edge-Localized-Modes (ELMs) are expected to present a significant transient flux of energy and particles to the ITER divertor. The threshold for ablation of the graphite target will be reached if the ELM transient exceeds Q/t1/2 to approximately 45 MJ m-2 s-1/2 where Q is the ELM deposition energy density and t the ELM deposition time. The ablation parameter in ITER can be determined by scaling four factors from present experiments: the ELM energy loss from the core plasma, the fraction of ELM energy deposited on the divertor target, the area of the ELM profile onto the target, and finally the time for the ELM deposition. Review of the ELM energy loss of Type I ELM data suggests an ITER ELM energy loss of 2-6{\%} of the stored energy or 25-80 MJ. The fraction of heating power crossing the separatrix due to ELMs is nearly constant (20-40{\%}) resulting in an inverse relationship between ELM amplitude and frequency. Measurements on DIII-D and ASDEX-Upgrade indicate that 50-80{\%} of the ELM energy is deposited on the target. There is currently no evidence for a large fraction of the ELM energy being dissipated through radiation. Profiles of the ELM heat flux are typically 1-2 times the width of steady heat flux between ELMs, with the ELM amplitude usually larger on the inboard target. The ELM deposition time varies from about 0.1 ms in JET to as high as 1.0 ms in ASDEX-Upgrade and DIII-D. The ELM deposition time for ITER will depend upon the level of conductive versus convective transport determined by the ratio of energy to particles released by the ELM. Preliminary analysis suggests that large Type I ELMs for low recycling H-mode may exceed the ablation parameter by a factor of 5. Promising regimes with smaller ELMS have been found at other edge operational regimes, including high density with gas puffing, use of RF heating and operation with Type III ELMs.},

abstract = {Edge localized modes (ELMs) are the focus of increasing attention by the edge physics community because of the potential impact that the large divertor heat pulses due to ELMs would have on the divertor design of future high power tokamaks such as ITER. This paper reviews what is known about ELMs, with an emphasis on their effect on the scrape-off layer and divertor plasmas. ELM effects have been measured in the ASDEX-U, C-Mod, COMPASS-D, DIII-D, JET, JFT-2M, JT-60U and TCV tokamaks,and are reported here. At least three types of ELMs have been identified and their salient features determined. Type 1 giant ELMs can cause the sudden loss of up to 10-15{\%} of the plasma stored energy, but their amplitude (Delta W/W) does not increase with heating power. Type 3 ELMs are observed near the II-mode power threshold and produce small energy dumps (1-3{\%} of the stored energy). All ELMs increase the scrape-off layer plasma and produce particle fluxes on the divertor targets which are as much as ten times larger than the quiescent phase between ELMs. The divertor heat pulse is largest on the inner target, unlike that of L-mode or quiescent PI-mode; some tokamaks report radial structure in the heat flux profile which is suggestive of islands or helical structures. The power scaling of type 1 ELM amplitude and frequency has been measured in several tokamaks and has recently been applied to predictions of the ELM size in ITER. Concern over the expected ELM amplitude has led to a number of experiments aimed at demonstrating active control of ELMs. Impurity gas injection with feedback control on the radiation loss in ASDEX-U suggests that a promising mode of operation (the CDH-mode) with very small type 3 ELMs can be maintained with heating power well above the II-mode threshold, where giant type 1 ELMs are normally observed. While ELMs have many potential negative effects, the beneficial effect of ELMs in providing density control and limiting the core plasma impurity content in high confinement II-mode discharges should not be overlooked.},

abstract = {In this paper we report results of scaling studies aimed at determining how the divertor conditions vary with plasma current, toroidal field, and neutral beam heating power in H-mode discharges with ELMs in the DIII-D tokamak. We find that ELMs produce relatively more direct particle losses (50{\%} or more of the total) than energy losses (???20{\%}). The time-average peak divertor heat flux in these plasmas is found to scale as d ?? (PNBIIp)(Bp,mp/Bp,div). The linear power dependence suggests that the plasma sheath at the targets is primarily responsible for limiting the parallel energy flow, while the Ip variation may mean that the radial energy transport in the SOL decreases with increasing plasma current, just as it does in the core. ?? 1992 Elsevier Science Publishers B.V.

abstract = {The L to H transition in the DIII-D tokamak [Plasma Physics and Controlled Nuclear Fusion Research 1986 (IAEA, Vienna, 1987), Vol. I, p. 159] is associated with two clear signatures: edge density fluctuations are abruptly suppressed (in almost-equal-to 100-mu-sec), while the edge poloidal rotation velocity upsilon-theta increases, implying that the radial electric field E(r) becomes more negative. Detailed new spectroscopic profile measurements show that the changes in upsilon-theta and E(r) generate a region of sheared electric field and poloidal flow of width almost-equal-to 3-5 cm. This region develops simultaneously with, and has the same spatial extent as, the edge fluctuation suppression zone as measured using a reflectometer system. Furthermore, the radial extent of the shear and fluctuation suppression zones encompass the location of the H-mode edge transport barrier. These observations are consistent with recent theoretical models of the L-H transition, and a comparison with these theories is presented. Data are also presented on the evolution of edge parameters and density fluctuations after the transition: the shear and fluctuation suppression layers are maintained for the duration of the quiescent H-mode phase, while relative density fluctuation levels decrease and interior plasma confinement gradually improves. Precursors to several different types of edge localized mode (ELM's) are also discussed.},
