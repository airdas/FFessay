abstract = {A qualitative as well as quantitative simulation of experimentally observed plasma parameters in the detached regime proves to be difficult for several tokamaks. A series of ohmic discharges have been performed in ASDEX Upgrade and DIII-D at as similar as possible plasma parameters and at different line averaged densities, over(n, ̄)e. The experimental data represent a set of well diagnosed discharges against which numerical simulations are compared. For the numerical modelling the fluid-code B2.5 coupled to the Monte Carlo neutrals transport code EIRENE is used. Only the combination of effects, such as geometry, drift terms, neutral conductance, increased radial transport and divertor target composition explains a significant fraction of the experimentally observed ion fluxes, $\Gamma$t, to the inner and outer target plates as a function of over(n, ̄)e in ASDEX Upgrade. The relative importance of the mechanisms leading to detachment differ in DIII-D and ASDEX Upgrade. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Recent experiments on DIII-D have increased confidence in the ability to suppress edge-localized modes (ELMs) using edge-resonant magnetic perturbations (RMPs) in ITER, including an improved physics basis for the edge response to RMPs as well as expansion of RMP ELM suppression to more ITER-like conditions. Complete ELM suppression has been achieved utilizing n = 3 RMPs in the ITER baseline scenario. In addition, RMP ELM suppression has been expanded to include plasmas with helium concentrations near 25{\%} and the use of n = 2 RMPs. Analysis of the kinetic profile response suggests that ELM suppression is correlated with the co-alignment of the $\omega$ ⊥e = 0 location, an n = 3 rational surface, and the top of the pedestal. Modelling predicts that such a co-alignment could potentially lead to island (or island chain) formation just inside the top of the pedestal, inhibiting the growth of the pedestal and thereby maintaining the ELM-free state. Detailed analysis of data obtained during toroidal phase variations of the applied n = 3 RMPs have provided further evidence of an island-like structure at the top of the pedestal. In addition, nearly matched discharges with co-neutral-beam-injection (co-NBI) and counter-NBI have demonstrated the importance of the presence of the $\omega$ ⊥e = 0 location for ELM suppression. In the counter-NBI cases, the toroidal rotation profile is such that there is no $\omega$ ⊥e = 0 location and ELMs are not suppressed in conditions in which ELM suppression is generally observed with co-NBI.},

abstract = {The mitigation or suppresion of large edge localized modes (ELMs) is a critical issue for successful operation of ITER. In recent years, a concerted worldwide effort has emerged to develop efficient and reliable ELM mitigation and suppression techniques that can be scaled to the full range of ITER regimes and more generally to burning plasmas in a generic fusion reactor design. These techniques include the use of small-ELM or ELM-free regimes, the repetitive triggering of ELMs by external means, and the suppression of ELMS with non-axisymmetric fields. The extrapolation of all of these techniques to ITER is highly uncertain due to outstanding physics issues. However, two techniques have emerged as the preferred methods for use in ITER: ELM pacing using pellet injection and the use of edge resonant magnetic perturbations for ELM suppression. This paper discusses the issues related to ELM control in ITER, provides a general introduction to various ELM control techniques, and a more detailed discussion of the physics and engineering requirements of the two preferred techniques for ELM control in ITER. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.},

This study is performed in$\backslash$ncomparison with results from TEXTOR-Dynamic Ergodic Divertor circular$\backslash$nlimiter plasmas.

In this paper$\backslash$na method is discussed to diagnose the degree of edge stochastization$\backslash$nbased on a comparison between modeled magnetic footprints on the$\backslash$ndivertor targets and experimental data. Clear evidence is presented$\backslash$nfor the existence of a generic separatrix perturbation causing$\backslash$nstriation of target particle fluxes. However, heat fluxes into these$\backslash$nstriations are small. This observation can be explained by accounting$\backslash$nfor the different heat and particle source locations and the 3D$\backslash$ntrajectories of the open, perturbed field lines toward the divertor$\backslash$ntarget. Analysis of the transport characteristics filling the$\backslash$nperturbed separatrix lobes based on initial EMC3/EIRENE modeling$\backslash$nsuggests the existence of open field lines connecting the stochastic$\backslash$nedge to the target pattern. However, the width and inward most extent$\backslash$nof the actual stochastic layer cannot yet be quantified.},

abstract = {One of the most severe problems for fusion reactors is the power load$\backslash$non the divertor target plates. Technically only power loads of less$\backslash$nthan 10 MW m-2 are acceptable. However, strong edge localized mode$\backslash$n(ELM) activity can lead to power loads in excess of 800 MW m-2. In$\backslash$norder to reduce the steady-state heat flux and the transient heat$\backslash$nflux due to ELMs, radiation cooling experiments were performed at$\backslash$nJET. Nitrogen was puffed into the divertor up to a radiative power$\backslash$nfraction of 90{\%}. This was achieved at a density of 0.85 times the$\backslash$nGreenwald density (Greenwald M 1988 Nucl. Fusion 28 2199), while$\backslash$nmaintaining an H-factor of fH98 = 0.82. The Zeff in all those discharges$\backslash$nstayed around 2.0. At approximately 55{\%} radiative power fraction,$\backslash$nthe ELM characteristic changes from type I to type III, resulting$\backslash$nin a loss of confinement of about 25{\%} due to a degradation of the$\backslash$nedge pedestal and hence a reduction of the ELM power load to the$\backslash$ndivertor tiles. By increasing the radiative power fraction to values$\backslash$nof about 90{\%}, the heat flux is reduced to 2 MW m-2.},

abstract = {The physics of diverters in tokamaks is reviewed, primarily from an experimental point of view, although where possible simple analytic modelling is included. The paper covers the four main subject areas at issue in divertor research: (1) the wide dispersal of plasma power exhausted from the main plasma, (2) the production of sufficiently high gas pressures in the vicinity of pump ducts to enable the removal of fuel and helium ('ash') gas from the system, (3) the elimination or reduction of impurity production and (4) the screening of impurities produced, or intentionally added, at the plasma boundary from the plasma core. A simple analytic model, the 'two-point' model, is introduced early in the paper and provides a framework for comparison of the experimental results, drawn from many machines, with simply derived expectations. Conclusions regarding the direction of future research priorities are made.},

This allows$\backslash$n us to compare the changes in density pump-out with the weighted magnetic diffusion coefficient,$\backslash$n using a simple particle diffusion model. We find that the density pump-out is vastly different in$\backslash$n the two confinement regimes, suggesting different particle transport mechanisms. Since one main$\backslash$n difference in transport characteristics between L- and H-mode is turbulence, we compare turbulent$\backslash$n particle characteristics. We find that in L-mode (MAST) the fluctuations and E × B shear increase at$\backslash$n the plasma edge, whereas in H-mode (DIII-D) the fluctuations decrease at the plasma edge. Deeper$\backslash$n inside the core, the E × B shear remains similar in L-mode (MAST), whereas a large decrease that$\backslash$n quickly saturates with RMP strength is observed in H-mode (DIII-D). These results suggest that the$\backslash$n RMP-induced particle transport at the plasma edge in L-mode (MAST) is the result from increases in$\backslash$n turbulent particle transport, whereas the results in H-mode (DIII-D) suggest a decrease in turbulent$\backslash$n particle transport.},

@article{Loarte2014a,
abstract = {Progress in the definition of the requirements for edge localized mode (ELM) control and the application of ELM control methods both for high fusion performance DT operation and non-active low-current operation in ITER is described. Evaluation of the power fluxes for low plasma current H-modes in ITER shows that uncontrolled ELMs will not lead to damage to the tungsten (W) divertor target, unlike for high-current H-modes in which divertor damage by uncontrolled ELMs is expected. Despite the lack of divertor damage at lower currents, ELM control is found to be required in ITER under these conditions to prevent an excessive contamination of the plasma by W, which could eventually lead to an increased disruptivity. Modelling with the non-linear MHD code JOREK of the physics processes determining the flow of energy from the confined plasma onto the plasma-facing components during ELMs at the ITER scale shows that the relative contribution of conductive and convective losses is intrinsically linked to the magnitude of the ELM energy loss. Modelling of the triggering of ELMs by pellet injection for DIII-D and ITER has identified the minimum pellet size required to trigger ELMs and, from this, the required fuel throughput for the application of this technique to ITER is evaluated and shown to be compatible with the installed fuelling and tritium re-processing capabilities in ITER. The evaluation of the capabilities of the ELM control coil system in ITER for ELM suppression is carried out (in the vacuum approximation) and found to have a factor of ∼2 margin in terms of coil current to achieve its design criterion, although such a margin could be substantially reduced when plasma shielding effects are taken into account. The consequences for the spatial distribution of the power fluxes at the divertor of ELM control by three-dimensional (3D) fields are evaluated and found to lead to substantial toroidal asymmetries in zones of the divertor target away from the separatrix. Therefore, specifications for the rotation of the 3D perturbation applied for ELM control in order to avoid excessive localized erosion of the ITER divertor target are derived. It is shown that a rotation frequency in excess of 1 Hz for the whole toroidally asymmetric divertor power flux pattern is required (corresponding to n Hz frequency in the variation of currents in the coils, where n is the toroidal symmetry of the perturbation applied) in order to avoid unacceptable thermal cycling of the divertor target for the highest power fluxes and worst toroidal power flux asymmetries expected. The possible use of the in-vessel vertical stability coils for ELM control as a back-up to the main ELM control systems in ITER is described and the feasibility of its application to control ELMs in low plasma current H-modes, foreseen for initial ITER operation, is evaluated and found to be viable for plasma currents up to 5–10 MA depending on modelling assumptions.},

abstract = {Analysis of Type I ELMs from ongoing experiments shows that ELM energy losses are correlated with the density and temperature of the pedestal plasma before the ELM crash. The Type I ELM plasma energy loss normalized to the pedestal energy is found to correlate across experiments with the collisionality of the pedestal plasma (v(ped)(*)),decreasing with increasing v(ped)(*). Other parameters affect the ELM size, such as the edge magnetic shear, etc, which influence the plasma volume affected by the ELMs. ELM particle losses are influenced by this ELM affected volume and are weakly dependent on other pedestal plasma parameters. In JET and DIII-D, under some conditions, ELMs can be observed ('minimum' Type I ELMs with energy losses acceptable for ITER), that do not affect the plasma temperature. The duration of the divertor ELM power pulse is correlated with the typical ion transport time from the pedestal to the divertor target (tau(parallel to)(Front) = 2piRq(95)/c(s,ped)) and not with the duration of the ELM-associated MHD activity. Similarly, the timescale of ELM particle fluxes is also determined by tau(parallel to)(Front). The extrapolation of the present experimental results to ITER is summarized.},

abstract = {The evolution of the parameters of the plasma in the termination phase of high confinement H-modes at JET with carbon fibre composite plasma facing components (JET-C) has been analysed with a view to predict the dynamics of the plasma energy decrease for sudden terminations of the ITER Q DT = 10 scenario caused by malfunction of additional heating systems. JET-C experiments show that the rate of decay of the plasma energy in the high performance H-mode termination phase is predominantly determined by the duration of the type III ELMy H-mode phase after the end of the type I ELMy H-mode regime. Longer type III ELMy H-mode phase durations lead to slower plasma energy decay rates. The duration of the type III ELMy H-mode phase is itself determined by the margin of the edge power flow (dominated by the rate of collapse of the plasma energy) over the H-mode threshold power in the termination phase, with larger margins leading to longer type III ELMy H-mode phase durations. For most of the JET-C discharges analysed the timescale for the plasma energy decrease in the termination of high energy confinement H-modes is comparable to the energy confinement time of the plasma in the high confinement phase rather than half of this value, which is to be expected for instantaneous H–L transitions. Modelling of the termination phase of ITER Q DT = 10 H-modes (with transport assumptions in this phase validated against JET-C experiments) shows that similar to JET-C results the timescale for the decrease of the plasma energy is comparable and can even be longer than the energy confinement time of the burning phase, provided that ELM control can be maintained. This is due to the long sustainment of the type III ELMy H-mode by the substantial edge power flow compared to the H-mode threshold power during this phase. The large edge power flow in the termination phase of ITER high Q DT plasmas is provided by the decrease of the plasma energy and the slow collapse of the alpha heating. Operational strategies in ITER to control the energy decay rate as well as the consequences of the lack of ELM control in the high Q DT termination phase are presented.},
